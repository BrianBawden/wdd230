          website is a good example of Hickâ€™s Law because of how there are three
          clear options to choose from at the top of the page: quilts, hammocks,
          or accessories. This allows users to quickly navigate to what they are
          interested in and not waste time searching for what they want. This
          will help ensure that people will stay engaged with the website and
          spend more time shopping.

      <div class="dp-3" id="thirds">
        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>

          <a href="https://www.amicalolafallslodge.com/" target="_blank"

        <p>
          For my example of the Rule of thirds I decided to use this
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-the-rule-of-thirds/"
            >blog</a
          >
          as my example because it talked about the rule itself. The part the I
          liked to most was the image of the man standing in front of the
          waterfall.
        </p>
        <p>
          This image is a perfect example of the rule of thirds. Do you see how
          the man in the red jacket in on the right third and bottom third of
          the picture? By placing him here your eye is drawn to him, but quickly
          moves on to the beauty of the water fall too.

        <p>
          I choose to use the
          <a href="https://m.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a> website to
          show the rule of alignment. I picked it for two reasons. First, the
          category bar shows a row of words allowing the user to know that by
          clicking on one they can narrow their search by those categories.
          Secondly, just below the category's are smaller thumbnails for short
          videos, again their alignment shows that they are all short videos.
