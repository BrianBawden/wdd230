        <p>
          I feel that the Hammock Gear website is a good example of Hickâ€™s Law
          because of how there are three clear options to choose from at the top
          of the page: quilts, hammocks, or accessories. This allows users to
          quickly navigate to what they are interested in and not waste time
          searching for what they want. This will help ensure that people will
          stay engaged with the website and spend more time shopping.

      <div class="dp-3" id="thirds">
        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <h3>Amicalola Falls</h3>
        <h3>
          <a href="https://www.amicalolafallslodge.com/" target="_blank"
            >Amicalola Falls</a
          >
        </h3>
        <div>
          <img
            src="../lesson2/images/amicalola-falls.png"
            alt="Amicalola Falls"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          For my example of the Rule of thirds I decided to use the Amicalola
          Falls website. The Falls are just 40 minutes from my house and I
          thought the picture showed good use of the rule of thirds by running
          the top of the water fall across the top third of the picture.

      <div class="dp-3" id="alignment">
        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <h3>YouTube</h3>
        <h3><a href="https://m.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a></h3>
        <div>
          <img src="../lesson2/images/youtube.jpeg" alt="YouTube page" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I choose to use the YouTube website to show the rule of alignment. I
          picked it for two reasons. First, the category bar shows a row of
          words allowing the user to know that by clicking on one they can
          narrow their search by those categories. Secondly, just below the
          category's are smaller thumbnails for short videos, again their
          alignment shows that they are all short videos.
